# Snake
This program is a simple clone of Snake. I've created it to get to know the very basics of SFML, before developing much more advanced project which I had been planning as the next one: [Boulder Dash](https://github.com/sgol13/boulder-dash).

## Compilation
Clone the repository and use a prepared bash script to compile and run the game:
```
git clone https://github.com/sgol13/snake-game.git
cd snake-game
./run                                                                                   
```
